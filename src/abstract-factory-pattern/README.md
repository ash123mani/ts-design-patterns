# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Summary

- Use when you want to provide a library of relatively similar products from multiple different factories.
- You want the system to be independent of how the products are created.
- It fulfills all the same use cases as the Factory Method but serves as a factory for creational pattern type methods.
- The client implements the abstract factory interface, rather than all the intern
